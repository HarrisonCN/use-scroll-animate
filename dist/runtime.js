/**
 * `motionary/runtime` (10.1) — Motionary's own zero-dependency animation
 * runtime, the one prerequisite for runtime-powered components:
 *
 * - shared **ticker** (`getTicker()`): one rAF loop for everything;
 * - **tween + timeline** engine with easing (`tween()`, `timeline()`, `EASES`, `cubicBezier()`);
 * - **module registry** (`use()`, `requireModule()`, `hasModule()`) with a
 *   clear `RuntimeModuleError` (install / import / CDN instructions) when a
 *   component needs a module that was not registered.
 *
 * Every other module lives at its own subpath (`motionary/runtime/format-css`,
 * `motionary/runtime/format-motion`, …) so you only pay for what you import.
 * SSR-safe (no `window` access at import) and usable in Web Workers.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { use, tween } from 'motionary/runtime';
 * use();                                   // registers the core (components can now find it)
 * tween('.box', { to: { x: 120, opacity: 1 }, duration: 500, ease: 'back-out' });
 * ```
